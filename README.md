# RestaurantAndroidApp

Built a working Android app for a small restaurant that could allow customers to browse the menu, place takeout orders, and process delivery updates. Using Android Studio and Google Firebase-Cloud services for storage (Firestore) and authentication, I learned the importance of various UI layouts, such as RelativeLayout or GridView, to effectively broadcast variable content and process real-time user input in a mobile app.  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41102741/202304084-2bf9f505-be49-49e4-ad2b-80ba31c3b459.png)
